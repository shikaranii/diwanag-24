Peace, as we know, is often understood as the lack of conflict of any form—a broad concept enclosed by meanings of goodness and harmony. As for me, peace is an outcome of justice and inclusivity. I see peace in the oppressed, reclaiming their voice. I see peace in a society where everyone has a rightful seat at the table.',
